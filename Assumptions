Assumptions

1) Since the requirement was for simulating weather data for 10+ regions, I have considered 12 locations.

2) From the various geography details available, i have obtained the lat,long and elevation.

3) Since this is consistent across the simulation, have mentioned these in a configurable file in resources folder called "Locations.txt". Any new location required also can be added or modified here

4) values for simulation are taken at random. So a random function to create a ISO8601 format date was created.

5) At any point of time, randomly the weather conditions are chosen. In the sample data, there were only three values - Sunny, Rain and Snow. These three alone will not be sufficient for all climatic conditions. So added two more values - Cloudy and Clear. This will almost cover all the weather conditions

6) For a given condition sunny, on analysis of various weather values, the temperature is always higher, pressure is in a range and humidity is low. At random, i have studied some of the past data across those regions. So finally came up with a minimum and maximum values for temperature, pressure and humidity.

7) Similar values are arrived at for other weather conditions like Cloudy, Clear, Snow and Rain. The file is in resources folder called "conditions.txt"

8) A random function to generate a value between these max and min values was created.

9) A string with all these values are populated and displayed onto stdout. Also a file is written for this in bin folder called "weatheroutput.txt". The user can make use of these for the simulation data
